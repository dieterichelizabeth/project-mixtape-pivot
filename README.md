This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a pomodoro app. Based on the user story-

- As a student
- I want to keep track of my study time
- So that I can take healthy breaks

Project-mixtape-pivot is a simple study app which allows the users to type what they are working on. After pressing "start", the user is presented with relaxing lo fi music and a timer starts. An inspirational/quirky quote is displayed to motivate the user. Once the time is up, an image is displayed, a timer begins and the user is reminded to take a break. Once the break timer runs out, the user is again able to input what they are working on and their progress is displayed under "Previous study sessions".

We were inspired by streamers doing pomodoro sessions on youtube/tiktok. "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks." -(credit: the Muse). We wanted to take the extra step of displaying multimedia in the form of relaxing photos, video/audio, and inspirational quotes.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML/CSS powered by jQuery and styled by Tailwind. The app includes Tailwind, jQuery, javaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.js. Multimedia features are delivered from Advice Slip API and Unsplash API.
